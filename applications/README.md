## Configuring new applications with ConsumerBench
Users can configure any custom applications that use local GenAI models, to run with ConsumerBench. The process of adding a new application to ConsumerBench is:

1. Create a new sub-directory in this folder for the application
2. Install the application in the sub-directory
3. Implement the `Application` interface. (Please see the existing applications, such as DeepResearch: [`DeepResearch/DeepResearch.py`](DeepResearch/DeepResearch.py).)
4. Register the application with ConsumerBench: Please create an instance of the application in `src/scripts/run_consumerbench.py`. Look for existing applications and similarly register the new application. 
4. You can then add your own applications to the workflows (specified in `configs/`), and the application will be monitored automatically with ConsumerBench

## Setting up existing applications

Currently, the ConsumerBench repository contains with 4 applications: Chatbot, DeepResearch, LiveCaptions and Imagegen. We have already added their classes in the corresponding directories. 

Following are the steps to install the applications, setup the inference backend with the model and the datasets specified in the paper. While we specify the model and dataset here which are used in the paper, users are free to download their own models and datasets to use with the applications. 

Before you start, intialize the submodules for each application with:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Chatbot 
#### Install application
Installing application involves setting up llama.cpp server.
```
cd <repo-dir>/inference_backends/llama.cpp
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DGGML_CUDA_F16=1 -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="75"  -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc
cd build
make -j32
```
Chatbot client then directly sends http requests to the llama.cpp server for each request.

### DeepResearch
Create a new conda environment with python 3.10. Activate the environment.
```
conda create -n deepresearch python=3.10
conda activate deepresearch
```

#### Install Application
```
cd DeepResearch/smolagents/examples/open_deep_research
pip install -r requirements.txt 
pip install -e ../../.[dev]
```

#### Download GenAI model
Download the Llama-3.2-3B model from huggingface. Note that you may need a huggingface account, and permission to download the gated llama model. 
```
wget https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-f16.gguf
mv Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-f16.gguf <repo-base>/models/
```


### Imagegen
Create a conda environment with python 3.10. Activate the environment.
```
conda create -n imagegen python=3.10
conda activate imagegen
```

#### Install Application
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install diffusers
pip install transformers==4.50.3
```

#### Download GenAI model
Download the stable-diffusion-3.5-large model from huggingface. Note that you may need a huggingface account
```
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/tensorart/stable-diffusion-3.5-medium-turbo
mv stable-diffusion-3.5-medium-turbo <repo-base>/models/
```


### LiveCaptions
Create a conda environment with python 3.10. Activate the environment.
```
conda create -n whisper python=3.10
conda activate whisper
```

#### Install Dependencies and libraries
```
conda install nvidia::cudnn cuda-version=12
pip install librosa soundfile
pip install faster-whisper
pip install torch torchaudio
pip install transformers
pip install datasets
pip install torchcodec
```

#### Download GenAI model
Download the Whisper-Large-V3-Turbo model from huggingface. Note that you may need a huggingface account
```
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo
mv whisper-large-v3-turbo ../models/
```

#### Prepare Dataset
LiveCaptions shows live audio captioning. In the paper, in order to simulate live captioning for multiple requests, we store the `distil-whisper/earnings21` dataset into wav files, and use each wav file as a single request for this application. 
```
conda activate whisper
cd <repo-base>/applications/LiveCaptions/
python whisper_streaming/generate_wav_dataset.py 
python whisper_streaming/split_wav_file.py --input_file ./whisper-earnings21/4320211.wav --output-dir ./whisper-earnings21 
```

#### Prepare Config
Make sure conda path in `whisper_online_client.sh` and `whisper_online_server.sh` are setup correctly.
Make sure ` --warmup-file` in `whisper_online_server.sh` is pointed to a correct warmup audio.
